    "text": "Description\nThe development and approval of new treatments generates large volumes of results, such as summaries of efficacy and safety from supporting clinical trials through the development phases. However, these results are often shared in formats that are suitable for presentation such as PDF, PowerPoint, or HTML documents with text, tables, and figures, but not machine-readable or amenable to further analysis. Although there is an agreement on which information should be shared as part of a data package, there is no standard way to share and reuse analysis results. A solution is to shift the focus from the application of the results (e.g., tables and figures) to a data model that captures the results.\nIn this workshop, you will learn about the Analysis Results Data Model (ARDM), a framework for storing and managing the outputs of data analyses. You will learn how the ARDM can help you overcome common challenges in clinical development, such as data reusability and reproducibility. Through case-studies, you will experience using the ARDM in real-world problems and scenarios."
